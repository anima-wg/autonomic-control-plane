Good point, done. (got a bit too long to paste here, so pls. check diff).

It would be useful to scope the feature that is proposed in this document, whether it is compatible of not with constrained environments, whether it needs adaptations, point on Michael's enrollment draft. It would also be useful to indicate whether the ACP works between L3 bridges, IOW whether ACP operates the same (over IP) regardless of the packet forwarding layer in the data plane;

Not sure i understand the "point on Michaels enrollment draft". 

I am happy to add pointers to variations of ACP design aspects for
informational purposes to show that/how it can be modified,
but Michaels drafts i think are all variation of the BRSKI design,
so the ACP would be completly unaffected by them, right ?

Wrt. constrained devices and L2. I didn't want to touch section 3
for what you suggested because that really a very formulistic
section going back to the charter 1 justifications of ANIMA  and
matched with the three numbered use case explanations in the
introduction.

Instead i wrote text at the end of the introduction, now section 1.1,
This got longer than i hoped, but it was really a big missing piece
to pitch the ACP and give early on context for implementers and
reminding of the charter goal of reusing the best available existing
protocols/function.

The text got longer specifically also because i did not want to fall
into the trap of making claims whether or not ACP is applicable to
specific IOT networks or (even worse) assuming IOT is always
constrained. Therefore mentioning of OT networks (IMHO big part of
IOT, and often totally non-constrained), explanation of why RPL,
and at the end a statement about constrained environments. There
is also a new paragraph in 10.8 about TCP/TLS vs. CoAP/DTLS as
a possible constained environment variant in the future.

Actually, section 1. introduction already mentions that the ACP provides
IPv6 and that the stable-connectivity document describes how
to interoperate with IPv4 only OAM.

I added to the new 1.1 section (see above) the following paragraph,
which i hope is a useful context setting and pitch:

<t>The ACP uses only IPv6 to avoid complexity of dual-stack ACP operations (IPv6/IPv4). Nevertheless, it can without any changes be integrated into even otherwise IPv4-only network devices. The data-plane itself would not need to change, it could continue to be IPv4 only. For such IPv4 only devices, the IPv6 protocol itself would be additional implementation footprint only used for the ACP.</t>

Added:

When a service announcer
using these parameters unexpectely dies immediately after sending the M_FLOOD,
receivers would consider it expired 210 seconds later. When a receiver tries to
connect this dead service earlier, it will experience a failing connection and
use that as an indication the service is dead and select another instance of the
same service instead.

Hmmm... Sure, why not. Less guessing/experiementation for this.

P27: An ACP node supporting native IPsec MUST use IPsec security setup
via IKEv2, tunnel mode, local and peer link-local IPv6 addresses used for
encapsulation. It MUST support ESP... (parameters).

clarified to:

P27: An ACP node that is supporting native IPsec MUST use IPsec security setup
via IKEv2, tunnel mode, local and peer link-local IPv6 addresses used for
encapsulation. It MUST then support ESP... (parameters).

Also:

ACP nodes supporting ACP via GRE/IPsec MUST support IPsec security setup..

clarified to:

An ACP node that is supporting ACP via GRE/IPsec MUST then support IPsec security setup..

Aka: P25 is correct, there is no single MTI. 6.7.3 defines the actual
requirement for two different profiles: "baseline ACP node" and "constrainted ACP node".
The two requirements in P27 are only conditional MUSTs defining the details of
the IPsec profiles assuming a node does support IPsec or IPsec/GRE.

Let me know if this is still unclear, and if so, how you would suggest
to make it better readable.

The best practice RFC 8064 recommends use of RFC 7217. I understand that privacy is not a concern but does it hurt? Anyway please point at section 6.10 and 6.11.1.11

The term "ULA-Random" was used in the discussions on ANIMA mailing list re.
ULA, so admittedly i didn't check that the term as it stands is actually
not defined/used in rfc4193 - but its just meant to imply ULA with L=1,
nothing more. I've removed the use of ULA-Random from the text and just
refer now to 4193 with L=1 (also pointing to 3.1. of rfc4193 defining L).

I have also added a note that the hash uses our own ACP definition instead
of rfc4193 3.2.2.

Paragraph is now:

<t>Use-ULA: For loopback interfaces of ACP nodes, we use Unique Local Addresses (ULA), as defined in <xref target="RFC4193"/> with L=1 (as defined in section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4193"/>). Note that the random hash for ACP loopback addresses uses the definition in <xref target="scheme"/> and not the one of <xref target="RFC4193"/> section 3.2.2.</t>

8064/7217 are irrelevant here if i understand it correctly because
we define the addressing scheme for anything following the ULA prefix
ourselves for ACP addresses. Let me know if i do misunderstad what
you where trying to suggest re. 8064/7217.

You only need MOP 2 or 3, 3 is you do multicast which at the moment does not appear to be the case. SO I would MUST a MOP of 2 and MAY a MOP of 3 which is a superset of MOP 2, and that's it (see 6.3.1 of RFC 6550).

Probably a transcription error on my side when i took your
RPL summary and wrote it down. Fixed according to above.

Added:

        <t>"Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)" according to
        <xref target="RFC4429"/> is RECOMMENDED because the likelyhood for
        duplicates between ACP nodes is highly improbable as long as

Ok, i am punting this one for now to RFC editor after playing around a bit
with the XML options - and not being satisfied... and having references for 50 RFCs in the doc:

<t>[RFC Editor: Question: Is it possible to change the first occurrances of [RFCxxxx] references to "<rfcxxx title>" [RFCxxxx] ? the XML2RFC format does not seem to offer such a format, but i did not want to duplicate 50 first references to be duplicate - one reference for title mentioning and one for RFC number.]</t>

If RFC editor comes back and can't do this easier than i can in XML,
i'll try to go through the chores when doc is in RFC editor queue.

Done.

"autonomic communications fabric" = ACP including ACP GRASP
(ACP GRASP provides discovery etc..). "security and transport
substrate" == the parts of ACP used by "ACP GRASP" (aka: The
secure IPv6 forwarding of ACP).

Subtle difference.

Fixed up "out of band" (no hyphens) and "in-band" (with hyphen).
Not sure why but this is what MS word spelling checker suggested
to me. RFC editor will override if these are not the best choices.

The definitions of those non-necessary terms are there to
help others who like me start out not being security
experts and are confused about those equivalent or
related terms.

I specifically didn't want to include discussions about these
terms in the definitions that are relevant (eg: IDevID) so
as not to clobber up that text. Instead, readers would just
look up those redundant terms when they are like me initially
confused about them.

Fixed to:

<t>The ACP relies on group security.  An ACP domain is a group of nodes that trust 
each other to participate in ACP operations.  To establish trust, each ACP member 
requires keying material: An ACP node MUST have a certificate (LDevID)
and a trust anchor (TA) consisting of a certificate (chain) used to sign the
LDevID of all domain members. The LDevID is used to cryptographically assert 
membership in the ACP domain, the TA to verify the membership of other nodes 
in the ACP domain (see <xref target="certcheck"/>).</t>

Gone. I added the note that LDevID can not be used directly for ACP to the

No, the Global ID. Fixed.

Actually, i also sumbled across this:

 RFC4193 uses "Prefix" for the first 7 bits of a ULA address, but
we have used use the term ULA prefix to refer to the first 48 bits of a ULA address,
so i've clarified this more in the terminology.

Sections 3, 4 and 9 are fairly short and the flow of the document
depends on them being in their particular location.

Section 10 could go into an appendix, but it makes not a lot of
difference, but past experience has shown that Annex text is
a lot less likely to be read given how the RFCs are structured.
