Good question:

The ACP spec serves to answer part of the Autonomic Network architecture
from NMRG and the reference model yet the terminology in this doc is
eliminating "autonomous". This and the following paragraph are create
the linkage between the larger architecture and original reason for the
ACP and the broader applicability of the spec.

yada yada... i feel it is appropriate to be at the top of the normative text
because of this linkage. And broader applicability beyond them.

Changed to:

The acp-node-name is not intended for end user consumption. There is no protection against an operator to pick any domain name for an ACP whether or not the operator can claim to own the domain name. Instead, the domain name only serves

The folks on ipsecme@ietf.org made it sound as if AH was Voldemort
 - the less you mention about it, the better. So i just expanded the word inline:

The IP Authentication Header (AH) MUST NOT be used

          <t>This document defines the use of ACP via DTLS, on the assumption that it is likely the first transport encryption supported in some classes of constrained devices: DTLS is commonly used in constrained devices when IPsec is not. Code-space on those devices may be also be too limited to support more than the minimum number of required protocols.</t>

Fixed by reply to another reviewers nit.
