DEFERRED, added instruction to text:

    <t>[RFC Editor: WG/IETF/IESG review of the terms below asked for references
       betwen these terms when they refer to each other. The only option in RFC/XML
       i found to point to a hanging text acronym definition that also displays
       the actual term is  the format="title" version, which leads to references
       like '->"ACP domain certificate" ()'. I found no reasonable way to eliminate
       the trailing '()' generated by this type of cross references. Can you
       please take care of removing these artefacts during editing (after conversion
       to nroff ?). Also created ticket to ask for xml2rfc enhancement to avoid this
       in the future: https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/ticket/347.</t>

Added xref to terminology section, added term to terminology section,
 used Wikipedia URL and first line description from it

  <t hangText="Operational Technology (OT):" anchor="ot">
    <xref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_Technology"/>:
    "The hardware and software dedicated to detecting or causing changes
    in physical processes through direct monitoring and/or control of physical
    devices such as valves, pumps, etc". OT networks are today in most cases
    well separated from Informationn Technology (IT) networks.

See above. I specifically added "->" because thats whats typically done
in other terminologies when there is a reference to another term.

> S2, "ACP Domain":  'of nodes with ->"ACP domain' . Remove "->" and ()?

Likewise.

I have tried to find some better examples of cross-references between
words in a terminology section of an RFC, but couldn't find any.

Aka: lets RFC editor figure it out and/or Hendrik via tooling and trac case.

Ok, got the point that the channel is not just an association but the
actual data channel, but your suggestion was binding the term to a
sequence of links, which i think is wrong too.

Replaced now with:

<t hangText="ACP secure channel:">A cryptographically authenticated and encrypted data connection 
 established between (normally) adjacent ACP nodes to carry traffic of the ACP VRF secure and
 isolated from Data-Plane traffic in-band over the same link/path as the Data-Plane.
</t>

> s2, "Data-Plane": s/non-autonomic/by means other than autonomically/

ACK

I have refrained from considering the terminology section to be normative so
far because i don't think i have ever seen this being done in other RFCs,
so i am only using those uppercase words in the normative sections.

Let me know if you disagree.

*yikes* several of these sneaked into the text, tried to eliminate all of them..

Actually now using consistently out-of-band

Changed to "infrastructure security (filtering based on known address space)".
