Thanks a lot Warren, great suggestions.

Changes for feedback from Mirja, Kumar and Joel committed to -16,
didn't create separate diff for individual reviewers as diff is not large. 
(Just ignore whole section 11 moved to appendix in diff.)

Good catch. The use of "global routing table" seems to be almost a day 1
text issue of the doc ;-(

We can't use VRF to explain it, because we are not referring to
VRFs in the data-plane anymore for those devices that do not have VRFs.
(reviewer request) Only ACP VRF is defined and used as a term.

I removed all uses of "global routing" (table), and just refer to
"Data-Plane routing (and forwarding, where appropriate) tables":

| Today, the management and control plane of networks typically uses a routing and forwarding table which is dependent on correct configuration and routing

| For management plane protocols, the ACP provides the functionality of a Virtual out of Band (VooB) channel, by providing connectivity to all nodes regardless of their Data-Plane configuration, routing and forwarding tables.

| Context separation improves security, because the ACP is not reachable from the Data Plane routing or forwarding table(s).

Took the opportunity fix also some semantics of the paragraph.

 <t>With the ACP, secure bootstrap of new devices and whole new networks can happen without requiring any configuration of unconfigured device along the path: As long as all devices along the path support ACP and a zero-touch bootstrap mechanism like BRSKI, the ACP across a whole network of unconfigured devices can be brought up without operator/provisioning intervention. The ACP also provides additional security for any bootstrap mechanism, because it encrypts the traffic along the path hop-by-hop.</t>

Added paragraph:

<t>Note that specific control plane functions for the Data-Plane often want to depend on forwarding of their packets via the Data-Plane: Aliveness and routing protocol signaling packets across the Data-Plane to verify reachability across the Data-Plane, using IPv4 signaling packets for IPv4 routing vs. IPv6 signaling packets for IPv6 routing.</t>

Changed to:

Mileage for ethernet based OOB does vary i think. Probably on DC and 
core/distribution SP gear. Not the typical enterprise gear yet, i think.

Good suggestion. Fixed.

Expansion of terms was introduced in -14.

Fixed to:
SHOULD be initialized automatically to a state in which ACP discovery can be performed

Done. See Discuss section.

First paragraph of previous chapter (admin-down) had (see below),

fixed to:

<t>Power consumption of "physical down" interfaces may be significantly lower than those in "admin down" state, for example on long range fiber interfaces. Bringing up interfaces, for example to probe reachabiliy, may also consume additional power. This can make these type of interfaces inappropriate to operate purely for the ACP when  
they are not currently needed for the Data-Plane.</t>

Joel Halpern also asked about DWDM. I'll refrain from trying to add more
details here how this situation could othrewise be mitigated, i just
wanted to highlight understood key aspects, not necessarily all solutions.
