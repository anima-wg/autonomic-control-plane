> I reread the Section 11 with your explanation in mind and see your perspective -- it's difficult to be specific without mandating a specific protocol.  However, there seems to be two concrete, normative elements of this architecture -- EST and GRASP.  The latter for bootstrapping and the formal for renewal.  It isn't clear then why their Sec Considerations don't apply.  Furthermore, the protocols and practices of the bootstrapping process are out of scope of this document but seem like a security building block on which ACP is being built.

Please check out the out the expanded version of the bullet list in section 11,
it should close the discuss. 

As Brian already explained on the list, ACP is rather the security mechanism of
ACP-GRASP, so it is ACPs choice of TLS for ACP-GRASP end-to-end that provides the
security to ACP-GRASP. I therefore just detailled the explanation how intercepting
or faking GRASP announcements for EST can cause issues.

As a corollary to the now hopefully good explanation of how registrars are out of scope,
i do now include text that says about BRSKI what i think is appropriate and helpfull
(aka: for 'ANI class' ACP nodes).

The main points that you didn't mention explicitly but that dawned on me when reviewing
the issue was mentioning of the security of the ACP certificate and beenfits and
security of an IDevID.

Given how you are always interested for security to be normative if possible:
I think it is quite appropriate to discuss those node implementation
issues ONLY informally (and not normatively) in the security considerations
section, because aspects such as secure boot, enforcment of (only) trusted software
execution and TPM for storage of certificates is really out of scope of this
doc, and AFAIK also IETF (and i wouldn't know what an appropriate set of 
TCG standards is that we might want to refer to...). Aka: None of these aspects
are specific to ACP  but apply really to any secure and trustworthy system that
deals with certificates.

Lastly, there is also a new requirement in 6.1.5.1 that is meant to prohibit the
misconfiguration or attack vector of making a node announce being an EST server,
when it can actually not talk to the right CA (not sure if this is easy to implement
though...).

Sentence removed.

Thanks a lot for the review!
