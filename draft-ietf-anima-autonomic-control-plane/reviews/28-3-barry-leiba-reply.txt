Great catch. Alice and Bob are often used in app area (SIP etc.), and i think also
in scurity area, but they are only "softly" associated with specific roles
(Alice is typically initiator). In the desccribed mechanism, the roles are
explicitly assigned as part of the negotiation, so its problematic trying to do this
with Alice/Bob.

The immediate replacement coming to mind was of course Master / Slave *sigh*.
(life was easier when we only had to care about technology.)

The new terminology is now "Decider" and "Follower". We looked up Decider as a perfect
valid Oxford English dictionary word and IMHO the most precise representation of
what the role is. Hopefully nobody wants to raise concern about this also being a Bushism.

Check the section rewrite.
It includes renaming, rewrite to address your points below, and two process refinements
i stumbled across doing the rewrite: how to sanely deal with terminating the negotiation
and not to do optimizations across multiple interfaces.

New text:

<li>Once the first ACP secure channel protocol connection passes peer authentication, the two peers know each other's certificate because those ACP certificates are used by all secure channel protocols for mutual authentication.  The peer with the higher Node-ID in the ACP address of its ACP certificate takes on the role of the Decider towards the other peer. The other peer takes on the role of Follower. The Decider selects which secure channel protocol to ultimately use.</t>

Yepp. Need to distinguish between name and roles. New text does this.

In the first textual example i now simply also use "Node 1", "Node 2" as the
names of the nodes. I guess i could change all text to use Alice/Bob as the names
(not the roles), but i do not feel strongly about it after my first fail to use them
in this context. And the whole long list example already uses Node 1 / Node 2.

Changed to:

The IKEv2 Diffie-Hellman key exchange group 19 (256-bit random ECP), MUST be support.  Reason: ECC provides a similar security level...

Improved explanation/added pointer:

<t>If IKEv2 initiator and responder support IPsec over GRE, it will be preferred over native IPsec because of the way how IKEv2 negotiates transport mode as used by this IPsec over GRE profile) versus tunnel mode as used by native IPsec (see <xref target="RFC7296" format="default"/>, section 1.3.1).

Aka: not a requirement, but rather (IMHO) a limitation of IKEv2

Tunnel mode always mandatory and you can only "up-negotiate" to transport mode.
quite an IPv4/Internet centric technology choice i learned during review with
ipsecme folks (tunnel mode being more resilient against NAT/FW etc..).

Thinking...

So i just deleted the whole paragraph:

- The first sentence is duplicating the IANA allocation section, 
  and from my memory of RFC its not typical to do this (or even to point to
  the IANA section).

- The rfc2119 MUST against future work (allocation) is of questionable value. 
  After all, a future RFC doing that last allocation could simply update
  the ACP RFC and invalidate the MUST. I don't even want to look up why
  i updated it from SHOULD to MUST to make another reviewer more happy.
  Given how this process meta discussion doesn't seem to fit in a simple
  paragraph where it can make all reviewers happy, its better done outside
  the RFC.

Wrt. to your argument about thinking further even now:
Through the time of the ACP spec, we did add more addressing options
because of WG/IETF review/discussion that we felt strongly about
(Vlong and Manual).  So IMHO we first need more implementation/deployment
experience before we do anything more on addressing. I don't think we will
need other spaces at all.

Having said that:

doing such an extension scheme is not really that difficult, we have
done it in the past in other protocols. But it does not make sense
to define an extension scheme before having an idea about the missing/
desired semantics (and hence space numbers vs. space sizes needed). 

Note also that there is another extension point, and that is to simply
use a new code-point in the otherName.

I now removed all the version numbers in the introductory text because of your and Bens feedback.

Changed to "that is only required"

I was using footprint because i thought it was the most commonly used term to
characterize broad system wide impact, e.g.: footprint ==

{development=(coding,testing), HW-resources (ASIC), runtime-resources=(memory,disk,cpu),
 operational/deployment-cost,...}

as in... (carbon footprint, ecological footprint, digital footprint, IETF footprint, ;-)

[ In the early years of ACP we had a lot of concerns by representatives of IPv4
  only device types for any of these aspects. Luckily it died down (time working
  for IPv6). Hope we do not need to fine-tune this further. Unless you have a short,
  better word suggestion. Let me know. ]

I better keep it. It serves as protection against the easy rathole discussion about what
we mean to be the constrained type of devices ACP would fit to. That ends up quickly
in referring to rfc7228 and having a couple years of discussions about how well
the code space required for various ACP components may or may not fit. And then we
need to make existence proof of all those "smaller than openssl" implementaton
options etc. pp...

Well... i removed the sentence after doing another scan through the
whole document that it is not necessarry (no use of CA without
"CA certificate" referring to the CA certificate).
Hopefully i did not miss anything.

This sentence was protection against overlooking any of these occurances.

I ended up creating a new section right at the start of section 6 about TLS and
moved all TLS requirements into it. The main benefit is hat this now applies
not only to GRASP, but EST, OCSP/CRLDP (if they use TLS) and BRSKI (for ANI nodes).

Had to move also the TLS specific crypto parameter requirements (to support the
certs/crypto suites desirable / requested by Ben).

For DTLS, i didn't feel such big movement was beneficial given how its only
used by one component: the somewhat "inspirational" DTLS secure channels. So i
just removed the repetitious versioning text from other places of the spec
and just point to the DTLS as secure channel section.

Amended to:

Addresses in the ACP are not considered sensitive on privacy grounds because ACP nodes are not expected to be end-user hosts and ACP addresses do therefore not represent end-users or groups of end-users.

This is text from a design meeting Pascal and I had at the prior IETF meeting
and that was included in -08 in 2017. Yes, it is shorthand because the whole
section conveys a long list of protocol parameters. I did like
the idea of having shorthand (as opposed to my usual long winding writing style),
and i think to remember to have seen shorthand in other RFC in similar places
(description of long list of protocol parameters).

There where several reviews commenting on the RPL section.
You are the first one who i think complains about this shorthand.

Changed to:

This filtering rule MAY be changed through administrative measures. The more any such administrative action enable reachability of non ACP nodes to the ACP, the more this may cause security issues.

Changed paragraph to:

When an ACP Edge node receives a packet from an ACP connect interface, the ACP Edge node
MUST only forward the packet into the ACP if the packet has an IPv6 source address from that interface (this is sometimes called "RPF filtering").  This filtering rule MAY be changed through administrative measures. The more any such administrative action enable reachability of non ACP nodes to the ACP, the more this may cause security issues.

Aka: The MAY is a followup to the prior MUST. That i think is what justifies rfc2119: The MUST/MA describe a security requirement: highly constrained accessibility of ACP by default, relaxation only by administrative action. Last new sentence explains why (security issues).

Thanks a lot for the review. Alas, finding the right text/solutions is
sometimes not as fast as one would like. Some of these replies required
me to sleep over them..

Thanks a lot!
