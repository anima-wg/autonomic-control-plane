Changes for feedback from Mirja, Kumar and Joel committed to -16,
didn't create separate diff for individual reviewers as diff is not large. 
(Just ignore whole section 11 moved to appendix in diff.)

Thanks. Lets take it offline. I am still interested to understand that
point, especially after the text i added in the hope to clear this concern.

Answers inline.

Thanks

Thats a topic better to be discussed in followup work. Cisco IOS ACP
implementation does support automatic VLAN discovery & selection.
Lot of experience/insight from that.  Trust me, it would be scope creep
for the ACP document itself.

Right. Given the experience with VLANs, the clean cut we could make
for this basic ACP specification is to logically sit on top of
IPv6 subnet interfaces, ignore all L2/L1 complexities 
and live with the dependency against IPv6 being able to bring up
link-local-scope reachability to neighbors. [ And then write followup
docs if/when we ever get this first doc out as an RFC ;-) ]

The way i would imagine WDM is a bit more like ethernet switches in section 7
though: You'd want to get ACP connectivity across your optical equipment
and also be able to reach through the ACP your optical equipment, but
that would not use special colors, but more likely should be added
to / leverage the existing in-band management channels of the optical
equipment. Long discussion. Let me rather stop.

Hmm... RFC1034 does not even mention the term "fully qualified (domain name)" / FQDN,
You seem to read RFC1034 3.5 to mean that all domain are FQDN, but that is
not clear to me. In the RR examples of RFC1034, FQDNs are identified by ending
with a ".", which AFAIK is the standard for FQDN,but the 3.5 syntax doesn't
even allow you to create such an FQDN, so i was thinking that 3.5 "domain"
do not have to be FQDNs, and therefore i am assuming that is is also perfectly
legal to use a syntax of domain3 = domain2 . domain1,
as in routing-subdomain = rsub . domain-domain-name.

Well, it does have to be some RFC822-local-part-FFS, but i think its a
lot better if its constrained to the domain name syntax, because it is
quite normal operations to have for every actual routing subdomain in the
network also some associated domain name, and that is what "routing-subdomain"
is.

So if i build a parser for configuring my segmented routing with the ACP,
its a lot more logical to allow only longer domain names for
routing-subdomain that all have the same parent domain (domain).

Right. See above.

I tried to figure out how to unconfuse this.

I changed "domain" to "acp-domain-name", so that its not confused
with RFC1034 "domain", eliminated "domain-name", and also changed
the definition of rsub to use RFC1034 "subdomain" instead of "domain",
even though i can for the heck of it not figure out what the difference
between domain and subdomain is, except that a domain can be " ", 
which seems to be the domain root, but its not really defined. 
But at least it should hopefully eliminate the misconception that rsub
has to be an FQDN.

Good catch. Fixed as follows:

The following points constitute the ACP domain membership check of a possible peer certificate, independent of the protocol used:
 The peer certificate is valid (lifetime).
 The peer has proved ownership of the private key associated with the certifictes public key.

No, the goal is to define this independent of protocol.
