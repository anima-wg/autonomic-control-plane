Michael, *:

Sorry, i am still not a native github speake and completely overlooked the textual improvement
you made in March before IETF104. It was a bit of a trouble trying to up-rev them after i had
already done all the other -19 review, but maybe one of these days i will catch those
github-only notifications.

Also integrated the proposed fix for HTTPs for EST connections.

Wrt cleaning up older documents on github: Thats nice, but please keep the .19.x.txt versions
as i have included those into the rfcdiffs of the changelog in the draft (as above).

Cheers
    Toerless
