Thanks, Mirja

Changes for feedback from Mirja, Kumar and Joel committed to -16,
didn't create separate diff for individual reviewers as diff is not large.
(Just ignore whole section 11 moved to appendix in diff.)

Done.

Depends on network. 60 seconds is goo enough for most networks and
should not create too much traffic for all current in-scope networks.
May probably need to be higher when we look more into IoT network.

But when i have some DC operator plugging in some spare switch into the
DC fabric and it needs to renew its cert before being able to operate,
and this guy has to wait in front of the switch until it runs before
he can move on , 60 seconds is eternity, and DC fabric would be happy
with 5 seconds too.

Aka: can't say a good minimum for all use-cases. SHOULD is ok.

(i hate periodic, but making this non-periodic is more work than fit this
 first round).

Right now we've defined only 2 channel mechanisms, IPsec and dTLS, so
i don't think we can reasonably worry about rate limiting when attempting
to do them in parallel. Especially because because the performance requirement
is not when you initiate, but when you respond.

Once there is more interest in other channel protocols, and we feel
there are important situations where you can't try them in parallel
(performance or othre reasons), i'd rather start standardizing
whats currently only written informationally: 
"Extending ACP channel negotiation (via GRASP)"
aka: you do only one secure GRASP connection, in it yo negotiate
IPSec, dTLS, MacSec, AvianCarriers, and then you follow with the one
choice mutually selected as the best from that list.

Aka: there is already an exit strategy from too many parallel options
should they happen to come into existance.

> 3) Sec 6.7.3: How are baseline ACP and constrained ACP nodes defined?

Elaborated text more to make it hopefully more self-explanatory:

<t>As explained in the beginning of <xref target="channel-selection"/>, there is no single secure channel mechanism mandated for all ACP nodes. Instead, this section defines two ACP profiles for ACP nodes that do introduce such requirements.</t>
<t>A baseline ACP node MUST support IPsec natively and MAY support IPsec via GRE.  A constrained ACP node that can not support IPsec MUST support DTLS.  An ACP node connecting an area of constrained ACP nodes with an area of baseline ACP nodes MUST therefore support IPsec and DTLS and supports threefore the baseline and constrained profile.</t>

fixed to:

...scheme MUST provide further extensions.

> 5) I guess section 10 could be moved to the appendix.

I did reorder section 10 subsection, so now section 10 is only what i consider
to be the important operational aspects of ACP, aka what hopefully will become
YANG model (config, diagnostics etc.) in the future. Section 11 is then
explanations and futures.

I am obnoxiously NOT a fan of appendices because there is good reason to
believe that text in an appendix will be more often ignored by readers. So
thats why i do not want 10. to be an appendix. But i now moved 11 into 
Appendix.

Hope this is goo dcompromise.
