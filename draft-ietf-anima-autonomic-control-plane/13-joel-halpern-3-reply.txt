Hi Joel (round 3)

Here is the github version after the fixes discussed below

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/master/draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane/draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane-14-jh3.txt

Here is the diff vs. the prior versin (round 2)

Alas (but i think for the better), after
all the questions from and discussion with you, i tried to figure out how
to best document the answers to the questions you raised, and it started
answering why we need multiple address range - because have to waste
48/46 bits on Registrar-IDs. Ok, Why ? Because we want multiple uncoordinated
registrars. Ok, what is a registrar. Especially when ACP does not use
BRSKI, which it claims it can. And how does certificate maintenance work
when you have multiple registrars. Aka: once i started to write text to
asnwer your questions i kinda got sucked into having the spec also answer
other questions.

So, with this rev., we now define and use the term "ACP Registrar",
and define that thats a BRSKI Registrar in ANI nodes, but it can be
anything in non-ANI ACP nodes. Does not have to be software. It could
be you, if you want the job.  Maybe Netconf or other protocols that 
want to compete with BRSKI.

Actually, verified i can be a registrar a long time ago, using old
crypto PKI CLI on ACP capable routers to manually hack in certificates
with specific properties i wanted. And getting them via web interface from
a CA.

So, i think this is a very clean solution of documentation. The normative
part of the spec now has what i think was the minimum to define the
requirements for any ACP registrar.

So, then there is an informative section explaining the need for the
multiple address spaces because of those uncoordinated registrars.
And an informative section about how you would need to set up
such uncoordinated registrars, aka: each with their own sub-CA. All
in section 10.3 now.

Then of course the whole point you made about about ACP addresses
being identifiers or not. So i wanted to document the point  that they
are, but that also meant to explain how the ACP address information
will survive in the presence of renewal and re-enrollment with a different registrar
(which may not know the nodes assigned ACP address unless its presented
during re-enrollment/renewal). Then of course the case where a cert
is revoked maybe indirectly, because the registrar was attacked, not
the ACP node gets a new cert from another registrar but of course this is
is the only case where you want it to get a certificate with new ACP
address information (because the prior registrar became untrusted so
you don't trust what ACP information it assigned).

So, this ended up being two new normative subsections in 6.1.3 -
re-enrollment and failing certificates, describing the requirements against ACP nodes
during renewal or failure of their cert.

The informative part of the doc also got a section about registrars documenting
hopefully the key pieces: how it works in general (so folks get
an idea how they would be built with or without BRSKI), what parameters
they need, discussion about that multi-registrar renewal and sub-CA
case, and finally a discussion about how registrars could integrate
with centralized policy control. After all, the world is SDN, so if
we'd only document the cool distributed registrar case, this wouldn't sell well
in todays world *sigh*.

The reasoning for this new text sections is all summarized/documented in the changelog for -14.

I'd like to point out  that even though this is a bunch of additional text,
it is in no way changing the way the ACP or registrars are meant to
operate. It is really just adding missing documentation about it.

Hope this answers your questions and resolves your discuss.

Cheers
