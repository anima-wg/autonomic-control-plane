An Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)
draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane-22

specifies the use of autonomically created IP-over-IPv6-Link-Layer tunnels
(in the "VTI" style) to create an in-band control plane.  (Replacing
out-of-band serial consoles reached by dial-up modems in some ancient cases)

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane-22#section-6.7.1.1
section 6.7.1.1.1 has a lot of words about requirements.

We are having a lot of back and forth within the WG and with ADs.
I think that we just say too much, and that RFC8221 really says it all.
Others say that RFC8221 mandates too much, and we don't need so much.
I am here to ask the IPsec WG what you'd want this document to say.

But, I say, RFC8221bis will say something different and then our text will be
wrong, so we just should say, "see RFC8221 and documents which update it"
(if there was a BCP# or STD# for RFC8221, we'd reference that instead)

An important thing is that RFC8221 is a Mandatory to Implement, but not
Mandatory to Use.  But, in an autonomic network, the idea is that there never
has to be configuration.  Implementers can and should consider which
algorithms they implement faster or in lower latency hardware, and prefer
those.

That could result in one end using hardware while the other end does
software, and that could even flip depending upon which end initiates, but
that's life.

The ACP does not need to move gigabits/s of traffic, it's for reliable
management traffic, and even on a multi-terabit routing platform, it's okay
if the management interface is limited by the speed of the control plane CPU
running IPsec in software.

6.7.1.1.1.  RFC8221 (IPsec/ESP)

   ACP IPsec implementations MUST comply with [RFC8221] (and its
   updates), with the following modifications to simplify hardware
   accelerated ACP IPsec implementation requirements by eliminating
   requirements for legacy or cryptographically weak options.

   ACP MUST NOT use any NULL encryption option due to the
   confidentiality of ACP payload that may not be encrypted by itself
   when carrying legacy management protocol traffics as well as hop-by-
   hop GRASP, which is designed to rely on the ACP for confidentiality
   of hop-by-hop distributed information.  Therefore, IPsec MUST support
   ESP and MUST NOT use AH.  For ESP, ENCR_NULL MUST NOT be used for ACP
   secure channels.

   Only ENCR_AES_GCM_16 is REQUIRED as an encryption algorithm for ACP
   secure channels with ESP.

   If an ACP node can perform ENCR_AES_CBC, ENCR_AES_CCM_8 at higher
   performance than ENCR_AES_GCM_16 or ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 at equal
   or higher performance than ENCR_AES_GCM_16 then that ACP node SHOULD
   support such an encryption algorithm and prefer it in the IKEv2
   negotiation if its performance is higher than that of
   ENCR_AES_GCM_16.  Otherwise there are no normative requirements
   against either of these options.  These requirements are overriding
   the MUST/SHOULD/SHOULD requirements of [RFC8221] for these three
   algorithms for the following reasons:

   o  There is no unconditional requirement against ENCR_AES_CBC because

      *  ENCR_AES_GCM_16 is assumed to be feasible with less cost/higher
         higher performance in modern devices hardware accelerated
         implementations compared to ENCR-AES_CBC.

      *  AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption with associated data
         (AEAD) cipher mode, so no ESP authentication algorithm

         requirement is needed (unless further encryption algorithms are
         supported), further simplifying ACP IPsec implementations.

      *  there is no requirement to interoperate with legacy equipment
         in ACP secure channels, so a single MTI encryption algorithm
         for IPsec in ACP secure channels is sufficient for
         interoperability.

   o  There is no unconditional requirement against ENCR_AES_CCM_8
      because it is currently not likely that it would be preferrable in
      ACP secure channels for more constrained IoT devices over options
      such as DTLS.  In [RFC8221] this algorithm is more desirable,
      because of solutions relying only on IPsec without such non-IPsec
      alternatives.

   o  There is no unconditional requirement against
      ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 because there is currently no mechanism in
      the ACP to migrate all secure channels in an ACP domain to a
      different preferred encryption algorithm in the case of future
      discovered crypto weaknesses of AES.  Once such mechanisms are
      defined, ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 would be a good encryption
      algorithm, but due to the transitive traffic through ACP secure
      channels only when this does not result in an unexpected drop in
      performance.

   When using AES for encryption, keys less than 256 bits MUST NOT be
   used, and 256-bit keys MUST be supported.

   Once there are updates to [RFC8221], these should accordingly be
   reflected in updates to these ACP requirements, for example if
   ENCR_AES_GCM_16 was to be superceeded in the future.
