I have done a more thorough spell check against -08 (converted to word
to leverage MS words spell checking *sigh*). I also received
a couple of explicit fixes from other reviewers that was included.

I am not aware of specific colloquialisms in the text (standard disclaimer
about english as a second language), but: i am happy to learn & improve
my english, and the experience with the RFC editor fixing up lazy language
was really excellent (just had another RFC published). So unless there
are more specific suggestions for textual changes, i will simply wait
until RFC editor takes over and ask him/her to beat us authors over
the head / help formalize colloquialisms.

Stable-connectivity was put onto the ANIMA charter to discuss one core
use-case for the ACP and thereby justify work on the ACP - and help refine
details of the ACP (draft ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane).

In the process of progressing both documents, i ended
up moving a lot of the details about how to do the things we want to
see happen from the informational stable-connectivity draft into the
normative ACP draft because that made the work more useful because it
created normative language (see evolution of ACP draft from ca. -08 to -13,
especially section 8.1). 

In the end, stable-connectivity can appear to be left looking a bit
like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_bank - all the difficult bits not
fit to standardize: transition work like NAT to overcome lack of IPv6 or
cool future stuff like MPTCP. Great but more work needed to standardize.

But:

I have repeatedly defended during working group last call the sections
about options of IPv4-IPv6 transition because i explicitly dealt 
with customers who had no other choice to get started and actually had me
document similar level of details - if you look at
IPv6 gap analyses, you should notice that networking equipment is a lot
further ahead than the randomn NOC solution/applications.

So, yes, i do agree that there is a risk to shy off possible adopters with
these details, but i hope its actually more helpful than scary: Depending
on familiarity with NAT, readers hopefully either decide to configure
their NAT if necessary or speed up their plans to get IPv6 also into their
NOC to be able to use an ACP. And not documenting this in detail is
like a bad sales pitch - "oh, sure, this will work fine... go figure  out
yourself the details".

Sorry for the rant ;-)

Thank you for the review and insightful comment!
