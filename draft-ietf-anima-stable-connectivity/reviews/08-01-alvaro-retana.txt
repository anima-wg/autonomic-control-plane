Thanks, Alvaro

I just posted -08: https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt

I have modified the verbage in -08 according to your suggestions.

A) GACP

Section 1.3 now introduces the four core design constraints of a
generic ACP (GACP) (VRF isolation, IPv6 only, NOC connectivity and Group Security)
which are the basis for the (existing/unchanged) discussion in the document.

The rest of the document has no semantic/content changes just textual
changes for ACP -> GACP. There are two places where the text still
refers to ACP specific examples and that is accordingly highlighted. 

B) Normative references

I went through the references and made those normative where i thought
rfc7322#section-4.8.6 "are essential to ... understanding the content"
applies. 

This set is of course somewhat subjective. Eg.: there is nothing special
to know about RFC6434, so its kept informational. On the other hand, if
you're a poor enterprise requiring to use any of the nasty NAT options
mentioned, you really want to read up on SIIT (RFC7915), so i made that
normative. Most customers i talked to did not know ULA (rfc4193), so i made it
normative. For fairness so then did the same for rfc1918.


The diffs regarding your DISCUSS are here (using the github commits
before/after):

http://tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcdiff/rfcdiff.pyht?url1=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/d26df831da2953779c3b3ac41ec118cbbe43373e/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt&url2=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/f2d8a85c2cc65ca7f823abac0f57d19c744f9b65/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt


I hope this resolves your discuss.

I am answering to the discus/comments raised by others during IESG review separately.

Cheers
