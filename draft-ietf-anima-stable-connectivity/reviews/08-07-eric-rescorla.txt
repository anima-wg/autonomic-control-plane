Hi Eric,

I just posted -08: https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt

I hope -08 of the draft resolves your comments: 

1)

>  secure ACP was extendable via untrusted routers then it would be a

This was fixed through review by Matthew Miller to say:

|  If the secure GACP was extendable via untrusted routers then it would
|  be a lot more difficult to verify the secure domain assertion.

[ Aka: This section is dealing with the problem of how to overcome
  the lack of cryptographic security on the legacy NOC devices (hopefully
  temporarily) with physical secured access to the trusted ACP edge device.
  So so we limit the options to build out that physcial security area
  to avoid the most common operator errors - messing up L3 routing/
  leaking routes. ]

2)

A bit of background to answer this question:

As part of resolving Alvaro Retanas DISCUSS, i extended section 1.3 to
explain that this document is not specific to the ACP (as specified
in draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane) but rather any (similar)
solution that meets contraints/requirements. And we call those GACP
(generalized ACP). The ACP of course is the first instance of such a GACP
that we want to standardize (via draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane).

The security constraint is now defined to be as follows in -08:

| Closed Group Security:  GACP devices have cryptographic credentials
|       to mutually authenticate each other as members of a GACP.  Traffic
|       across the GACP is authenticated with these credentials and then
|       encrypted.  The only traffic permitted in & out of the GACP that
|       is not authenticated by these credentials is through explicit
|       configuration the traffic from/to the aforementioned non-GACP NOC
|       equipment with subnet connections to a GACP-edge device (as a
|       transition method).

The text you where calling out is now:

| In result, data-plane connectivity that
| does support this can simply leverage TLS/DTLS
| ([RFC5246])/([RFC6347]) with those GACP credentials for mutual
| authentication - and does not incur new key management.

Aka: for this stable-connectivity draft (informational), i changed the
text from "certificates" to cryptographic credentials for authentication
as a more generic term because some GACP in the IoT space may use
non-certificate cryptographic security (but rather shared secrets).

Note that in the case of the ACP, those credentials are of course certificates,
the mutual authentication is specified in:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane-13#section-6.1.2
Aka: the "closed group" is identified through the "domain" field
in a new certificate element for the ACP (we can discuss more
hopefully soon when we get to IESG review of the ACP document, and
why we didn't rely on the existing domain field of "web" certificates).

But the main point of this section in the stable-connectivity draft
was really only the simple statement that devices already have their 
GACP credentials, so they can equally use them for end-to-end authentication
via the data-plane.

Good catch. Thanks!

Thanks.

Yes... Paragraph changed as following to fix This. Also to include
another update that i unfortunately noticed only just now ;-(:

| To help diagnose packets that unexpectedly leaked for example from 
| another GACP (that was meant to be deployed separately), it can be
| useful to voluntarily list your own the ULA GACP prefixes on some
| site(s) on the Internet and hope that other users of GACPs do the
| same so that you can look up unknown ULAprefix packets seen in your 
| network. Note that this does not constitute registration.
| https://www.sixxs.net/tools/grh/ula/ was a site to list ULA 
| prefixes but it is not open for new listings anymore since the mid
| of 2017. The authors are not aware of other active Internet sites to
| list ULA use.

No RFC2119 disclaimer included. No capital MUST/SHOULD/MAY. 

This is an informational document that was put onto ANIMA charter to
validate the work on draft-ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane 
by discussing the stable-connectivity use-case. In the ACP drafts
there is of course RFC2119 language also for these details.
 Hope for your review there to catch any missing capitalization.

Hope these answers resolve your comments.

Thanks & Cheers
