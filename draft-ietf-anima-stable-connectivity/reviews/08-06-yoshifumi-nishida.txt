Mirja, Yoshifumi

I just posted -08: https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt

I have reworked the MPTCP text based on your threads feedback with
the intention to fix errors and have it answer the questions/concerns raised,
but without otherwise changing the scope of it:

- What are they key features making MPTCP interesting
- How could it be used to solve the stable-connectivity issue
- Disclaimer that THIS REQUIRES ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATION WORK
  beyond the scope of this document
- Describe the areas of specification work required
  - API/policy, control by apps
  - dealing with dual VRF addresses

Please check diff in this URL (not complete diff of -08, just fix for your discuss/comment):

http://tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcdiff/rfcdiff.pyht?url1=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/14d5f9b66b8318bc160cee74ad152c0b926b4042/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt&url2=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/c02252710fbd7aea15aff550fb393eb36584658b/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt

I hope this resolves your DISCUSS/comments.

Note that the term ACP was changed in the doc to GACP based on resolving Alvaros discus. See:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/master/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/08-01-alvaro-retana.txt

Thank you
