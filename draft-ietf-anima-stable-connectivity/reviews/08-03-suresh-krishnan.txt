Tahnk you, Suresh

I just posted -08: https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt


The paragraph in question was changed as follows for -08:

| One architectural expectation for the GACP as described in
| <xref target="GACP"/> is that all devices that want to use the
| GACP do support IPv6. Including NMS hosts Note that this expectation
| does not imply any requirements against the data-plane, especially no
| need to support IPv6 in it. The data-plane could be IPv4 only, IPv6 only,
| dual stack or it may not need to have any IP host stack on the network
| devices.

I hope this resolves your comment.

Cheers
    Toerless

P.S.: 

Note that in response to Alvaros DISCUSS, the document now uses the term "GACP"
(generalized ACP) and defines in <xref target="GACP"/> the architectural
expectations (constraints) for GACPs. The reason for this was to make it clear
that this document is not specifically discussing only the ACP as it finally will
come out of the ANIMA WG (hopefully ;-) but any type of solution that is 
an automatically built, isolated, secured (VRF) for inband management network
with IPv6 only - connecting to NOC/NMS.

[ The reason why i think this will help the document is that it a lot more
  clearly distinguishes between the principles under which the stable-connectivity
  document applies and the details in the ACP spec. And it may be useful also when
  variations of the ACP may get defined - this stable connectivity is then still
  applicable. ]
