Hi,

Here are my comments on this draft. In general it seems to be ready,
but there are some issues that IMHO need fixing. Here they are,
followed by a few nits that I noticed.

Technical issues:
-----------------

> 2.1.3.  Simultaneous ACP and data plane connectivity
...>    If the data-plane of the network is also supporting IPv6, then the
>    NOC devices that need access to the ACP should have a dual-homing
>    IPv6 setup.  One option is to make the NOC devices multi-homed with
>    one logical or physical IPv6 interface connecting to the data-plane,
>    and another into the ACP.

I don't understand the need to call this "dual-homing". That generally
implies a physical topology with multiple links and/or routers. I think
all you mean is that the nodes happen to have at least two addresses
in different IPv6 prefixes (one for the data plane and one for the
ACP). Having multiple addresses is a standard feature of IPv6. It might
be done with multiple (virtual or real) interfaces, but it doesn't need
to be. So I suggest:

  If the data-plane of the network also supports IPv6, then the
  NOC devices that need access to the ACP should have both data-plane
  and ACP IPv6 addresses. One option is to set up the NOC devices with
  one logical or physical IPv6 interface connecting to the data-plane,
  and another into the ACP.

>    The LAN that provides access to the ACP
>    should then be given an IPv6 prefix that shares a common prefix with
>    the IPv6 ULA...

1) It is surely a virtual interface, not a LAN.
2) I think it is better to say
 "should then be given an IPv6 prefix that lies within the ULA prefix..."

(In fact, it doesn't matter that it's a ULA - what matters is that
it's the prefix that covers the whole ACP. That really goes for the whole
document; a ULA prefix is just another prefix, after all. It might be
clearer to just say "ACP prefix" everywhere.)

>    ... so that the standard IPv6
>    interface selection rules on the NOC host

Cite [RFC6724] for complete clarity.

>    If this can not be achieved
>    automatically, then it needs to be done via simple IPv6 static routes
>    in the NOC host.

But it can. That's why RFC6724 exists. Do we really need to say this?

...
>    Providing two virtual (eg: dot1q subnet) connections into NOC hosts
>    may be seen as undesired complexity. 

Either you have to explain 'dot1q' and give a reference, or delete it.
I'd delete it.

...

That seems like an explanation of very basic routing - does it need to
be said?

> In the most simple case, we get the following topology:...

This part isn't very clear to follow. The ASCII art of Fig. 1
and Fig. 2 is a bit scrappy, and the explanation is a bit short.
It would be better to start with an explanation of the terms
like 'NOClan' and 'Rtr1'. And you suddenly start discssing VRFs
without any definition.

I full agree with the message but I think the wording has the wrong tone.
The goal should be to welcome NOCs to the new world of IPv6, not to
tell them they are dinosaurs. Something like:

   The implication of this architectural decision is the potential need for
   short-term workarounds when the operational practices in a network
   do not yet meet these target expectations.  This section explains
   when and why these workarounds may be operationally necessary and
   describes them. However, the long term goal is to upgrade all
   NMS hosts to native IPv6, so the workarounds described in this
   section should not be considered permanent.

...

>    NOClan.

I think this (and the following paragraph) is underspecified. It isn't
clear to me whether this would be described as a NAT64 or a NAT46 scenario
(which side is the client and which side is the server, in other words).
There's a lot more to specify to make this work - maybe the details are
out of scope, which should be stated if so. Also, it would be better
to say 'IP/ICMP translation' not 'NAT' and cite RFC7915. Make that
clearly separate from the issue of how addresses are mapped.

(Incidentally, recall that (a) IPv4 addresses are only 32 bits and
(b) we own the ACP address plan. So algorithmic mapping of IPv4
addresses into a special /96 in the ACP address plan is possible.
Of course that would be an insecure zone in ACP terms.)

> 2.1.5.  Path selection policies

A lot of this section comes across almost as hand-waving. I did
wonder whether it would have been enough just to state the
problem.

...
>    MP-TCP (Multipath TCP -see [RFC6824]) is a very attractive candidate
>    to automate the use of both data-plane and ACP...

I'm not sure... you seem to be asking for new intelligence in
MPTCP's choice of candidate addresses, not just a policy but
a whole mechanism in support of that policy. And will you really
benefit from MPTCP's main point, which is automatic load management
between alternative paths. Wouldn't SCTP be a better match?

That NOTE needs to be cleared up. Something like 464XLAT (RFC6877)
might be a good compromise.

> 3.  Security Considerations
...

Was this pasted from the ACP draft? Surely that is where ULA is proposed.

I don't like that phrase: it isn't the *address* that's random,
it's the /48 prefix. Also, somebody is always ready to complain
about the collision risk. Suggest:

   The random nature of a ULA prefix provides strong protection
   against address collision even though there is no central assignment
   authority.

I think all that is a red herring. I suggest replacing it by a simple
statement:

   If packets with unexpected ULA addresses are seen they should
   be discarded.

(Even that is not really needed, since all border routers should
discard such packets anyway.)

>    Using current registration options implies that there will not be
>    reverse DNS mapping for ACP addresses.

Really? I assume we're talking about two-faced DNS, and afaik nothing
stops an operator providing reverse mapping in the private DNS.
That seems to be implied by the following paragraphs, so the text
seems inconsistent anyway.

> 4.  No IPv4 for ACP

This section seems out of place stuck between Security Considerations
and IANA Considerations. Maybe it should be an Appendix, referenced
in section 2.1.4. "IPv4 only NMS hosts".

Nits/English:
-------------

(There are probably other nits as well as these, which the RFC Editor
will fix...)

> Abstract
...
>    ...  Provisioning during device/network bring

Suggested:

  Provisioning while bringing up devices and networks
  tends to be more difficult to automate than service provisioning
  later on, changes in core network functions impacting reachability
  cannot be automated because of ongoing connectivity
  requirements for the OAM equipment itself, and widely used OAM
  protocols are not secure enough to be carried across the network
  without security concerns.

>    This document describes how to integrate OAM processes with the
>    autonomic control plane (ACP) in Autonomic Networks (AN). to provide
>    stable and secure connectivity for those OAM processes.

Suggested:

  This document describes how to integrate OAM processes with the
  autonomic control plane (ACP) in Autonomic Networks (AN) in order to provide
  stable and secure connectivity for those OAM processes.

> 1.2.  Data Communication Networks (DCNs)

This needs a complete informational reference. Also, according to
https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.7712-200303-S/en it is a superseded
reference, so maybe there is a better one?

Define "ASA" when first used.
