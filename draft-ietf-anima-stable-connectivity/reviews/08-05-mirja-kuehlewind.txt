Mirja, Yoshifumi

I just posted -08: https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt

I have reworked the MPTCP text based on your threads feedback with
the intention to fix errors and have it answer the questions/concerns raised,
but without otherwise changing the scope of it:

- What are they key features making MPTCP interesting 
- How could it be used to solve the stable-connectivity issue
- Disclaimer that THIS REQUIRES ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATION WORK
  beyond the scope of this document
- Describe the areas of specification work required
  - API/policy, control by apps
  - dealing with dual VRF addresses

Please check diff in this URL (not complete diff of -08, just fix for your discuss/comment):

http://tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcdiff/rfcdiff.pyht?url1=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/14d5f9b66b8318bc160cee74ad152c0b926b4042/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt&url2=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/c02252710fbd7aea15aff550fb393eb36584658b/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity-08.txt

I hope this resolves your DISCUSS/comments. 

Note that the term ACP was changed in the doc to GACP based on resolving Alvaros discus. See:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anima-wg/autonomic-control-plane/master/draft-ietf-anima-stable-connectivity/08-01-alvaro-retana.txt

Thank you

After it is operating, the shim libraries on both ends add their data-plane address (MPTCP ADD_ADDR) and attempt to build a new subflow between those addresses. If that (data plane) subflow is successfully built, the shim libraries could shift all traffic over this subflow which should be forwarded hardware accelerated by the network - and use the ACP subflow across the ACP solely for signaling - beause it is most resilient against failure.
